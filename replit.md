# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The application uses a modern React-based stack with TypeScript for type safety and maintainability. The UI is built with shadcn/ui components providing a consistent design system, while Tailwind CSS handles styling with a healthcare-focused color theme. The application follows a modular component architecture with clear separation between layout, forms, data visualization, and business logic components.

## State Management
State is managed through React hooks and context patterns, with @tanstack/react-query handling server state caching and synchronization. A custom mock data hook (useMockData) provides a complete data layer abstraction for development and prototyping, simulating real backend operations including CRUD operations for UBS, ONGs, patients, and social equipment.

## Routing and Navigation
React Router DOM provides client-side routing with protected routes ensuring authentication requirements. The layout system includes a responsive sidebar navigation and mobile-friendly header with search capabilities.

## Authentication System
The application features a production-ready authentication system with PostgreSQL session persistence, structured audit logging, and comprehensive security hardening. Built with passport.js local strategy, the system enforces email verification in production, implements session regeneration to prevent fixation attacks, and uses secure cookie configuration. All authentication events are logged with JSON structure for monitoring and compliance.

## Map Integration
Google Maps JavaScript API integration provides interactive mapping capabilities with custom markers for different entity types (UBS, ONGs, patients, social equipment). The map component supports layer toggling, edit mode for marker positioning with drag-and-drop coordinate updates, and real-time updates. Includes geolocation services through Capacitor for mobile device support. Advanced geocoding system uses Google Places API as primary source with intelligent fallback to Geocoding API and ViaCEP, featuring automatic retry with exponential backoff, address enrichment, and 4-layer filtering for maximum precision in Brazilian addresses.

## Form Management
React Hook Form with Zod validation provides robust form handling throughout the application. Forms include patient registration, UBS/ONG management, and data import interfaces with comprehensive validation and error handling.

## Calendar System
The Agenda page features a sophisticated calendar month view that displays patient appointments in a visual grid format. The calendar uses date-fns with Portuguese Brazilian locale, showing a fixed 42-day layout (6 weeks × 7 days) with proper weekday alignment. Events are indicated with colored dots (blue for próximo atendimento, green for último atendimento), and clicking on any day reveals a detailed list of patients scheduled for that date. Month navigation is smooth with previous/next controls, and the system includes performance optimizations through memoized data processing.

## Mobile Support
Capacitor integration enables mobile app deployment with native device features like geolocation. The responsive design ensures optimal experience across desktop and mobile devices.
