# Overview

This is a georeferencing system for social assistance and health services in Samambaia, Recanto das Emas, and √Åguas Claras. The application maps healthcare facilities (UBS), NGOs, and patients, providing intelligent pairing between patients and nearest healthcare units based on geographic proximity and service availability. It features an interactive map interface, comprehensive management dashboards, and data import capabilities.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The application uses a modern React-based stack with TypeScript for type safety and maintainability. The UI is built with shadcn/ui components providing a consistent design system, while Tailwind CSS handles styling with a healthcare-focused color theme. The application follows a modular component architecture with clear separation between layout, forms, data visualization, and business logic components.

## State Management
State is managed through React hooks and context patterns, with @tanstack/react-query handling server state caching and synchronization. A custom mock data hook (useMockData) provides a complete data layer abstraction for development and prototyping, simulating real backend operations including CRUD operations for UBS, ONGs, patients, and social equipment.

## Routing and Navigation
React Router DOM provides client-side routing with protected routes ensuring authentication requirements. The layout system includes a responsive sidebar navigation and mobile-friendly header with search capabilities.

## Authentication System
The application includes a complete authentication system based on session-based auth with email verification support. Currently implemented with mock data for frontend development, but structured to easily integrate with a real backend. Uses passport.js for strategy-based authentication and includes user registration, login, logout, and profile management.

## Map Integration
Google Maps JavaScript API integration provides interactive mapping capabilities with custom markers for different entity types (UBS, ONGs, patients, social equipment). The map component supports layer toggling, edit mode for marker positioning, and real-time updates. Includes geolocation services through Capacitor for mobile device support.

## Form Management
React Hook Form with Zod validation provides robust form handling throughout the application. Forms include patient registration, UBS/ONG management, and data import interfaces with comprehensive validation and error handling.

## Mobile Support
Capacitor integration enables mobile app deployment with native device features like geolocation. The responsive design ensures optimal experience across desktop and mobile devices.
